Danske Bank,"Review for Danske Bank

Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

As a loyal customer of Danske Bank for over 40 years, I‚Äôve always appreciated their reliability. However, my recent experience has been frustrating. I needed a temporary overdraft extension of just ¬£800 for two weeks due to a client delay. What should have been a simple request turned into hours of phone calls, long wait times, and a lack of personal touch. Each representative seemed disconnected, and I felt more like a number than a valued customer.

Due to this impersonal and inefficient service, I&apos;ve decided to switch to the bank where I hold my business account. I hope Danske Bank will improve their customer service to better support their long-term clients in the future.","Customers are generally very satisfied with this company.

Danske Bank,"Their customer service is the worst, it takes forever for them to reply to any kind of communication. Just now I have spent over an hour just waiting on phone call to be connected to a customer service representative.

I really don&apos;t understand how they have this good rating on trust pilot. 

They should change their automatic voice when you call them to:

The LEGO Group,I was in the Lego shop in Glasgow Buchanan Galleries before Christmas and I bought a lego jaws set for a Christmas present. I was greeted as I entered the store which was a pleasant start to the experience. The store was tidy and had the products set up nicely in categories about the store which made it easy to navigate. I was also asked by a member of staff while I was browsing if I needed any assistance and the lady was helpful finding the item I was looking for and reassured me it was a good choice I was making due to the popularity of the set. The gentleman at the till was also very helpful asking me how my day was going which was lovely and spoke about our Christmas plans. Excellent service from start to finish and the same lady who greeted front of store me wished me a good day as I left. 11/10 all staff are a credit to the store and are very knowledgable and friendly,"Customers are generally unhappy with their experiences with this company.

I didn‚Äôt want to get on the Lego band wagon of being ripped off for tiny bits of plastic. But succumbed for Xmas. Never again.
The fools in customer care well they got told what I thought they were in the numerous emails. 
I must have sent 20 + emails with the code for both pieces. I received the same repetitive email from Lego!! ‚ÄòWhat are the codes‚Äô‚Ä¶.. I ended up calling. They had the AUDACITY to say we‚Äôll send them for free!! I said Don‚Äôt make it look like you‚Äôre doing Me A Favour!!!
You should be sending them free!! ITS UOUR INADEQUACIES IN THE FIRST PLACE!!
I‚Äôve already paid over the odds for bits of plastic!! I don‚Äôt expect you to have missing pieces! Then experienced horrendous customer service!!

The LEGO Group,"On Christmas Eve my grandson came to me in tears. The door 24 had been opened on his Harry Potter Advent Calendar; it was empty! I immediately raised a complaint using the &quot;Resolver&quot; system which Lego completely ignored. As I had not had a response to the &quot;Resolver&quot; complaint I contacted Lego customer service to get the pieces that should have been behind
door 24. After a few days I received a patronising reply about naughty elves tampering with the Lego Advent Calendar!! This company is a disgrace, they don&apos;t care about the children they upset only profits from selling plastic toys at exorbitant prices.

The LEGO Group,"Poorly prepared for holidays
Surely one would expect a company like Lego to be well prepared for online sales around the holidays.
This is very disappointing at Lego&apos;s.
The website states that you need to order well in advance. For boxes, I understand that somewhat, although some procurement policy in the countries works wonders.
That you have to wait 10 days before your gift card is being shipped, I find quite absurd.

Google,"My Google Pixel 8 developed screen issues 9 months after purchase. The phone is completely undamaged and the symptoms are identical to a known screen issue that you can find described on Reddit. Google itself acknowledges the issue and even advertises an extended repair program for it. I sent my phone in for repair and they have refused to repair it unless I pay $370. They won‚Äôt say why. I have been getting the runaround from support for over two weeks and now the repair request has expired and they are returning the phone.

This is the third Pixel phone that I‚Äôve owned that has died from manufacturer defects within two years of purchase. Every time it has been a known issue acknowledged by Google. Every time they have refused to stand behind their product.

IKEA,My suggestion would be to never do online orders with Ikea. The nearest IKEA is a five hour drive or I have to cross the border into Canada for a four hour drive.

IKEA,"Just an all round poor experience. Multiple delays to our delivery. Received 2 doors and then 2 weeks later the rest of our order arrived with very short notice. Fortunately we were in. Several items with significantly damaged and there were shoe marks over all our packages as people had clearly been walking over them. The quality is so poor now that this will be the last time we use Ikea. Its a shame as they used to represent value for money but now they charge premium prices for inferior and damaged product. This is the second time to have this experience in the last year, the first time I put it down to bad luck but it&apos;s a theme.

IKEA,"Picked up two Stig Stools both in Packaging i only found out one had been put together before then re packaged when i got home.
Obviously there were scratches on the black frames and most of the screws were rounded off and no instructions lucky i had bought two.
It&apos;s a 70 mile round trip !
Phoned IKEA to ask if they could send some new screws but they just sent me a new Stool.
Great service üëè

IKEA,"Bought some mattresses in packaging that was open on one side. I tried to return them, unused, but was told because the packaging was open they wouldn&apos;t accept it. Had to argue for a long time, eventually they did offer the refund when they checked their stock and realised that it was sold how I was returning it. Didn&apos;t enjoy the customer services person indicating I was a liar. Tried to return another item, but the staff member said it wasn&apos;t returnable despite it not being listed as an exception online. I asked him to show me where in the terms and conditions it states this, but he wasn&apos;t able to. 

The Reading store was very busy, lots of things not on the shelves, people queuing 45 minutes to get a meal, at click and collect you face long waits for your items to be dumped on the side without a person handing them over, or anyone to answer your questions.

I had food that tasted off, cold was hard was  unedible. 
I returned the food to the restaurant as requested to get a full refund which I had to go through just eat to get. 

Just eat a refusing to give me a refund and I&apos;ve only given me a ¬£9 credit I spent nearly 40 pounds on food that I did not eat. 

This restaurant in question also I discovered afterwards it only has a one-star food safety rating. 
When restaurants have a one star food safety rating the are strongly advised to close.

Lidl GB,"Normally Tesco shoppers but thought we would give Lidl a try , however after two or three weeks went back to Tesco. We found the shopping experience not as good, no cafe, no clothes or household items and very limited choice and availability, we were having to still go to Tesco for items that weren&apos;t available in Lidl. Another turn off was having no scan as you shop which makes checking out so much easier. Not convinced about the quality of some of there products either , some diced beef we bought was particularly poor. Some products are definitely cheaper but we still prefer Tesco.","Customers are largely dissatisfied with this business.

When I cut them open there was a distinct aroma of stagnant water. I started wondering how they even can grown that way.
Highly advise you to beware their reduced price items. There&apos;s a reason why they&apos;re flogging them cheap.
Don&apos;t even ask me about their Dentalux watery toothpaste. I&apos;ve been a Lidl shopper for years but how they scrimp and cut back on quality and good measure of ingredients is appalling.

Audi,"Took car into Whetstone for service and mot. Asked for a couple of items to be looked at at the same time which they said nothing about. They didn‚Äôt leave the wheel nut lock key in the car and the service centre doesn‚Äôt answer the phone and main number just keeps putting through to them and said the best thing is for me to go and collect it in person - so I have to waste at least 45 minutes of my time to do a round trip because they hadn‚Äôt returned this routine item.

Audi,"In July 2024, I sold my Audi Q5 bought in 2015 in Abu Dhabi. I had numerous technhical breakdowns during these years but worst of all, it was the customer experience at Nabooda Auto in Dubai. Unwilling to accept repairs under warranty (altho promised for 5 years) for static parts e.g. coolant water tank, stench in the cabin emanating from the engine space, etc. Altho I wrote to Audi HQ in Germany, they nonchalantly referred me to their equally lacklustre authorized agent in Dubai - Nabooda Auto. My complaint was escalated to the CEO of Nabooda who demanded I meet him in person &amp; when I did, he insulted me. When looking for a new car, I did not even bother exploring an AUDI as once bitten, twice shy. ","Customers are generally very satisfied with this company.

Audi,"We agreed for a delivery on 1st of November due to technical reasons it was changed to 5th of November.
When we went on 5th for car pickup the car was not there and ordered to be delivered. This was due some internal staff miscommunication. Hence we were just send home with no car. After two days we got the call that the car is ready in a day so we can pick it up but as we had no time anymore we got the car delivered at our home address.
The introduction was sufficient but the Audi connect and app could not be set. And still the car is unable to connect to my profile. Waiting still for contact from service. ","Customers are generally very satisfied with this company.
